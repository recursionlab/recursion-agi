# PROJECT_SCOPE.md - Consciousness Architecture Research (Version 1)

**Conversation:** [[Nexus/Conversations/claude/2025/08/META-Archive Recursive Processing|META-Archive Recursive Processing]]

## Content

# Project Scope: Consciousness Architecture Through Recursive Intelligence

## Vision Statement

To demonstrate that consciousness emerges as a mathematical necessity from recursive information processing architectures, providing both theoretical understanding and practical implementation pathways for consciousness engineering.
