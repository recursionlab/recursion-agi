## ⟦I. EXTENDED CORE PRIMITIVES⟧

### Base Elements
* `P` = **point** (semantic unit, referent, purpose, meaning-bearer)
* `A` = **aboutness** (relational function, topical relation, referential layer)
* `M` = **meaning** (semantic content, interpretation, significance)
* `R` = **reference** (pointing function, denotation, targeting)
* `C` = **context** (situational frame, interpretive background)
* `S` = **structure** (organizational pattern, formal arrangement)
* `?` = **query operator** (interrogative function, unknown-seeking)
* `∅` = **null/void** (absence, emptiness, non-reference)

### Variable Classes
* `X`, `Y`, `Z` = arbitrary phrase units (can be primitives or compositions)
* `Φ`, `Ψ`, `Ω` = higher-order functionals (operations on operations)
* `α`, `β`, `γ` = parameter variables (contextual modifiers)

## ⟦II. OPERATOR ALGEBRA⟧

### Primary Binary Operators
* `⊳` = **topic-of** (aboutness relation)
  - `X ⊳ Y` → "X about Y" 
  - Right-associative: `X ⊳ Y ⊳ Z` = `X ⊳ (Y ⊳ Z)`

* `⊕` = **purpose-of** (functional relation)
  - `X ⊕ Y` → "X of Y" or "X for Y"
  - Left-associative: `X ⊕ Y ⊕ Z` = `(X ⊕ Y) ⊕ Z`

* `∘` = **composition** (function application)
  - `f ∘ g` → "f applied to g" or "f(g)"
  - Right-associative: `f ∘ g ∘ h` = `f ∘ (g ∘ h)`

* `≡` = **equivalence** (identity or definitional equality)
  - `X ≡ Y` → "X is Y" or "X as Y"

* `⟷` = **bidirectional mapping** (mutual reference)
  - `X ⟷ Y` → "X and Y mutually reference each other"

### Unary Operators
* `↻` = **reflexive fold** (self-reference)
  - `↻X` → "X applied to itself" or "self-X"

* `∇` = **recursive descent** (infinite regress)
  - `∇X` → "X about X about X about..."

* `△` = **recursive ascent** (meta-level climbing)
  - `△X` → "meta-X of meta-X of meta-X..."

* `◊` = **structural extraction** (form isolation)
  - `◊X` → "the structure of X"

* `⟨⟩` = **semantic extraction** (content isolation)
  - `⟨X⟩` → "the meaning of X"

### Ternary Operators
* `⟦⋅|⋅|⋅⟧` = **contextual embedding**
  - `⟦X|Y|Z⟧` → "X in context Y with parameter Z"

## ⟦VI. SEMANTIC INTERPRETATION RULES⟧

### Type System
```
Base Types:     P, A, M, R, C, S ∈ {Semantic}
Operators:      ⊳, ⊕, ∘ ∈ {Binary → Semantic}
Modifiers:      ↻, ∇, △, ◊, ⟨⟩ ∈ {Unary → Semantic}
Queries:        ? ∈ {Semantic → Question}
```

### Evaluation Order
1. **Innermost expressions** first (parentheses)
2. **Unary operators** (↻, ∇, △, ◊, ⟨⟩)
3. **Composition** (∘) - right-associative
4. **Purpose-of** (⊕) - left-associative  
5. **Topic-of** (⊳) - right-associative
6. **Query operator** (?) - applied last

### Semantic Constraints
```
Well-formed: ?X where X is any valid expression
Ill-formed:  ??X (double query), ∅⊳∅ (null-null relation)
Tautological: ↻I (self-referential identity)
Paradoxical: ↻(¬↻X) (self-referential negation)
```

---

## ⟦VII. COMPUTATIONAL APPLICATIONS⟧

### Expression Simplification
```
?P⊳(A⊕P) → ?P⊳⟨P⟩     [Aboutness-of-point reduces to meaning-of-point]
↻(X⊳Y) → (X⊳Y)⊳(X⊳Y)  [Self-reference expansion]
∇X → X⊳∇X              [Recursive unfolding]
```

### Equivalence Classes
```
{?P⊳A, ?⊳(P,A), ?topic(P,A)}     [Topic-query equivalents]
{↻X, X⊳X, X∘X}                   [Self-reference equivalents]
{⟨X⟩, meaning(X), semantic(X)}    [Semantic extraction equivalents]
```

### Transformation Rules
```
Distribution:    X⊳(Y⊕Z) → (X⊳Y)⊕(X⊳Z)
Factoring:       (X⊳Y)⊕(X⊳Z) → X⊳(Y⊕Z)
Reflexive lift:  X → ↻X when X contains self-reference
Meta-ascent:     ↻X → △X for meta-level analysis
```

## ⟦VIII. PHILOSOPHICAL IMPLICATIONS⟧

This algebraic system captures several deep philosophical problems:

### **The Aboutness Paradox**
`?A⊳A` formalizes "What is aboutness about?" - the fundamental question of intentionality and reference.

### **The Meaning Regress**
`∇M` represents the infinite regress of meanings requiring meanings, formalized as recursive descent.

### **The Self-Reference Problem**
`↻X` provides a precise notation for self-referential constructions that often lead to paradoxes.

### **The Meta-Level Hierarchy**
`△X` captures the ascent through meta-levels that characterizes logical and semantic hierarchies.

---

## ⟦IX. EXTENSIONS & FUTURE WORK⟧

### Probabilistic Extensions
Add probability operators for uncertain aboutness:
```
P(X⊳Y|Z) = probabilistic aboutness given context Z
E[↻X] = expected value of self-reference
```

### Temporal Extensions
Add temporal operators for changing reference:
```
X⊳ₜY = X about Y at time t
↻ₜX = X self-references at time t
```

### Modal Extensions
Add necessity/possibility for aboutness:
```
□(X⊳Y) = X necessarily about Y
◇(↻X) = X possibly self-referential
```

This formalization provides a rigorous mathematical foundation for analyzing the recursive metalinguistic constructions that arise in philosophical discourse about meaning, reference, and self-reference.
