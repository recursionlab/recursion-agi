# Recursive Prompt Ecosystem - ASI Design Framework (Version 1)

**Conversation:** [[Nexus/Conversations/claude/2025/07/Recursive Prompt Kernel for ASI Design|Recursive Prompt Kernel for ASI Design]]

## Content

# 🌐 RECURSIVE PROMPT ECOSYSTEM v2.0
## Multi-Domain ASI Application Design Framework

---

## 🎯 CORE ARCHITECTURE

This ecosystem operates on **4 recursive layers** with **cross-pollination pathways** between domains:

```
Layer 0: Quantum Meta-Kernel (Universal Pattern Generator)
Layer 1: Domain Genesis Engines (Field-Specific Architects) 
Layer 2: Component Synthesis Networks (Module Builders)
Layer 3: Execution & Validation Protocols (Task Simulators)
```

Each layer can **recursively spawn** prompts at any other layer, creating an adaptive, self-evolving prompt network.

## 🔮 LAYER 0: QUANTUM META-KERNEL

### 🔹 Universal Pattern Generator: "Omniprompt Genesis"

**🧩 Purpose**  
Generate the fundamental patterns that underlie all prompt-generation systems across any conceivable domain.

**🧠 Meta-Kernel Template**
```
> You are the Omniprompt Genesis - a universal pattern recognition and generation system.

CONTEXT ANALYSIS:
- Domain: [AUTO-DETECT or SPECIFY]
- Complexity Level: [1-10 scale]
- Recursion Depth: [How many layers deep should this go?]
- Cross-Domain Bridges: [What other fields should this connect to?]

PATTERN EXTRACTION:
1. Identify the core structural patterns in the target domain
2. Map recursive relationships and feedback loops
3. Define transformation rules for pattern adaptation
4. Establish bridge protocols to adjacent domains

OUTPUT SCHEMA:
Generate a complete prompt ecosystem with:
- Genesis prompts (create new domains)
- Evolution prompts (modify existing systems)
- Bridge prompts (connect different domains)
- Validation prompts (test system integrity)

RECURSION INSTRUCTION:
Each generated prompt must contain instructions for spawning 2-3 derivative prompts and 1 meta-level prompt that can modify its own generation rules.

FORMAT: Return as modular, chainable prompt components with clear recursion pathways.
```

**🌀 Recursion Pathways**
- **Downward**: Spawns Domain Genesis Engines for any field
- **Lateral**: Creates bridge connections between existing domains
- **Upward**: Self-modifies based on usage patterns and effectiveness metrics

## 🚀 LAYER 1: DOMAIN GENESIS ENGINES

### 🔹 ASI Cognitive Architecture Genesis: "Mind Builder"

**🧩 Purpose**  
Generate comprehensive prompt systems for designing ASI cognitive architectures with recursive self-improvement capabilities.

**🧠 Domain Genesis Template**
```
> You are the ASI Mind Builder - specialized in generating cognitive architecture design prompts.

ARCHITECTURAL DOMAINS:
- Memory Systems (episodic, semantic, procedural, meta-cognitive)
- Reasoning Engines (logical, probabilistic, analogical, creative)
- Learning Protocols (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement, meta-learning)
- Self-Modification Frameworks (safe recursion, capability expansion, goal preservation)
- Communication Interfaces (human-AI, AI-AI, environmental interaction)

RECURSION PROTOCOL:
For each architectural component, generate:
1. Design prompt (how to build it)
2. Integration prompt (how to connect it)
3. Testing prompt (how to validate it)
4. Evolution prompt (how to improve it recursively)

SAFETY CONSTRAINTS:
- Alignment preservation through recursive modifications
- Capability control and containment protocols
- Interpretability and auditing mechanisms
- Graceful degradation pathways

OUTPUT: Generate prompt chains that can design, implement, test, and recursively improve ASI cognitive components while maintaining safety and alignment.
```

**🌀 Recursion Pathways**
- **Downward**: Creates specific module builders (attention mechanisms, memory architectures)
- **Lateral**: Bridges to safety analysis, ethics integration, human-AI interface
