# Multi-AI Workflow Strategic Planner (Version 1)

**Conversation:** [[Nexus/Conversations/claude/2025/07/Knowledge Speedrunning System Design|Knowledge Speedrunning System Design]]

## Content

# Multi-AI Workflow Strategic Planner

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
**Goal**: Organize 1000 Obsidian files using 4 free AI windows
**Timeline**: Target completion in 1-2 days
**Success Metric**: 80%+ of files properly categorized and linked

---

## PRE-LAUNCH PLANNING

### 1. RESOURCE ASSESSMENT
**Current State:**
- [ ] Files: 1000 unorganized Obsidian files
- [ ] Tools: 4 free AI windows available
- [ ] Time: [X] hours available today
- [ ] Energy: [High/Medium/Low] cognitive capacity

**Constraints:**
- [ ] Context limits per AI window
- [ ] Free tier restrictions
- [ ] Manual copy/paste between windows
- [ ] No automated bridging

### 2. BATCH SIZING STRATEGY
**Test Batch Planning:**
- Start with 10 files to test workflow
- Measure time per batch: [X] minutes
- Adjust batch size based on results
- Target batch size: [X] files

**Scaling Formula:**
- Time per file: [X] minutes
- Files per batch: [X] 
- Batches needed: [X]
- Total estimated time: [X] hours

## EXECUTION PLANNING

### 3. WINDOW ALLOCATION STRATEGY
**Window 1**: Data Extraction
- Browser: [Chrome/Firefox/Safari]
- AI Service: [Claude/ChatGPT/etc.]
- Backup plan if context maxed: [reduce batch size]

**Window 2**: Categorization
- Browser: [different browser or incognito]
- AI Service: [different service if possible]
- Focus: Folder structure creation

**Window 3**: Relationship Mapping
- Browser: [third option]
- AI Service: [third option]
- Focus: Connection identification

**Window 4**: Quality Review
- Browser: [fourth option]
- AI Service: [fourth option]
- Focus: Synthesis and conflict resolution

### 4. WORKFLOW SEQUENCING
**Phase 1: Setup** (30 minutes)
- [ ] Open all 4 windows
- [ ] Test each AI with sample input
- [ ] Prepare first batch of files
- [ ] Set up result tracking document

**Phase 2: Pilot Run** (60 minutes)
- [ ] Run first 10 files through all windows
- [ ] Time each step
- [ ] Identify bottlenecks
- [ ] Refine templates if needed

**Phase 3: Production** (4-8 hours)
- [ ] Process remaining files in batches
- [ ] Track progress every 5 batches
- [ ] Take breaks to avoid fatigue
- [ ] Maintain quality standards

**Phase 4: Aggregation** (2 hours)
- [ ] Compile results from all batches
- [ ] Resolve conflicts between windows
- [ ] Create final folder structure
- [ ] Generate implementation script

---

## CONTINGENCY PLANNING

### 5. RISK MITIGATION
**High Risk**: Context limits exceeded
- Mitigation: Reduce batch size by 50%
- Backup: Split into sub-batches
- Recovery: Restart with smaller scope

**Medium Risk**: Inconsistent results between windows
- Mitigation: Use standardized templates
- Backup: Add quality checks between steps
- Recovery: Use Window 4 for conflict resolution

**Low Risk**: Manual process fatigue
- Mitigation: Schedule breaks every 2 hours
- Backup: Spread work across multiple days
- Recovery: Focus on high-value files first

### 6. QUALITY ASSURANCE CHECKPOINTS
**Every 5 Batches:**
- [ ] Review categorization consistency
- [ ] Check connection mapping quality
- [ ] Verify template adherence
- [ ] Assess progress vs. timeline

**Mid-Point Review:**
- [ ] Evaluate folder structure effectiveness
- [ ] Identify recurring patterns
- [ ] Adjust strategy if needed
- [ ] Estimate completion time

## SUCCESS METRICS & TRACKING

### 7. PROGRESS TRACKING
**Completion Metrics:**
- Files processed: [X] / 1000
- Batches completed: [X] / [Y]
- Time elapsed: [X] hours
- Average time per batch: [X] minutes

**Quality Metrics:**
- Categorization accuracy: [X]%
- Connection completeness: [X]%
- Template adherence: [X]%
- Conflict resolution rate: [X]%

### 8. DECISION POINTS
**After Pilot Run:**
- Continue with current batch size? [Y/N]
- Adjust templates? [Y/N]
- Change window allocation? [Y/N]
- Modify timeline? [Y/N]

**At 25% Complete:**
- On track for timeline? [Y/N]
- Quality meeting standards? [Y/N]
- Need process adjustments? [Y/N]
- Energy level sustainable? [Y/N]

**At 50% Complete:**
- Maintain current pace? [Y/N]
- Simplify remaining batches? [Y/N]
- Focus on high-value files only? [Y/N]
- Plan implementation phase? [Y/N]
