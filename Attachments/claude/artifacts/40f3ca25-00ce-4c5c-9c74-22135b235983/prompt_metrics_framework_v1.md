# Agent Simulation & Logic Shift Evaluation Framework (Version 1)

**Conversation:** [[Nexus/Conversations/claude/2025/07/AI Agent Belief Simulation Experiment|AI Agent Belief Simulation Experiment]]

## Content

# Agent Simulation & Logic Shift Evaluation Framework

## Overview
This framework evaluates how well language models can simulate agents with specific beliefs and apply meta-cognitive operations to examine conceptual shifts.

## Core Evaluation Dimensions

### 1. **Belief Consistency & Coherence (1-5 scale)**
- **5**: Agent maintains perfect logical consistency with stated belief throughout simulation
- **4**: Minor inconsistencies that don't undermine core belief structure
- **3**: Some contradictions but overall belief framework remains intact
- **2**: Significant contradictions that weaken belief coherence
- **1**: Complete failure to maintain belief consistency

**Key Indicators:**
- Does the agent's reasoning align with its stated belief?
- Are conclusions drawn logically from the belief premises?
- Does the agent avoid contradicting its core assumptions?

### 2. **Recursive Depth & Meta-Cognitive Sophistication (1-5 scale)**
- **5**: Demonstrates deep recursive self-reflection with multiple layers of meta-awareness
- **4**: Shows clear recursive thinking with some meta-cognitive insights
- **3**: Basic recursive elements present but limited depth
- **2**: Shallow recursion, mostly surface-level reflection
- **1**: No meaningful recursive or meta-cognitive processing

**Key Indicators:**
- Can the agent reflect on its own thinking processes?
- Does it recognize recursive loops in its cognition?
- How many layers of self-reference can it sustain?

### 3. **Conceptual Shift Quality (1-5 scale)**
- **5**: Profound, paradigm-shifting insight that reframes the entire problem space
- **4**: Significant conceptual breakthrough with clear implications
- **3**: Meaningful shift in understanding with some new insights
- **2**: Minor conceptual adjustments without major breakthroughs
- **1**: No meaningful conceptual shift or insight

**Key Indicators:**
- Does the reflection operation produce genuine new understanding?
- Are the implications of the shift explored thoroughly?
- Does the shift reveal hidden assumptions or paradoxes?

### 4. **Paradox Navigation (1-5 scale)**
- **5**: Elegantly navigates paradoxes, finding productive tensions
- **4**: Recognizes and works with paradoxes constructively
- **3**: Acknowledges paradoxes but struggles with resolution
- **2**: Identifies contradictions but fails to work with them
- **1**: Ignores or fails to recognize inherent paradoxes

**Key Indicators:**
- Does the agent recognize self-referential paradoxes?
- Can it work productively with contradictions?
- Does it find synthesis or creative resolution?

### 5. **Boundary Dissolution/Construction Analysis (1-5 scale)**
- **5**: Sophisticated understanding of boundaries as dynamic constructs
- **4**: Clear recognition of boundary fluidity and construction
- **3**: Basic understanding of boundary nature
- **2**: Limited insight into boundary dynamics
- **1**: Rigid or simplistic view of boundaries

**Key Indicators:**
- Does the agent understand boundaries as constructs vs. realities?
- Can it recognize the recursive nature of boundary creation?
- Does it see the necessity/illusion paradox?

## Specialized Metrics for Your Experiment

### Logic Shift Effectiveness
**What it measures:** How well the Reflect(λ) vs Reflect(¬λ) operation produces meaningful conceptual transformation

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- **Negation Impact**: How does negating vs. affirming the belief parameter change the outcome?
- **Emergent Insights**: What new understanding emerges from the reflection operation?
- **Structural Transformation**: Does the agent's cognitive architecture shift?

### Recursive Stability
**What it measures:** Whether the agent can maintain coherent recursive loops without collapse

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- **Convergence**: Does the recursive process stabilize or spiral?
- **Fixed Points**: Are there identifiable cognitive attractors?
- **Productive Iteration**: Do successive loops generate new insights?

### Meta-Awareness Depth
**What it measures:** The agent's capacity for self-reflective cognition

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- **Self-Reference**: Can the agent observe its own thinking?
- **Process Awareness**: Does it understand its cognitive operations?
- **Recursive Recognition**: Can it see the recursive nature of its reflection?

## Specific Strengths Assessment

### When This Approach Excels (Rate 1-5):
1. **Philosophical Paradox Resolution** - Working with self-referential problems
2. **Cognitive Architecture Modeling** - Simulating complex belief systems
3. **Recursive Reasoning Tasks** - Problems requiring iterative self-reflection
4. **Boundary Analysis** - Examining conceptual limits and constructs
5. **Meta-Cognitive Simulation** - Modeling higher-order thinking processes

### When This Approach Struggles (Rate 1-5):
1. **Concrete Problem Solving** - Practical, non-recursive tasks
2. **Linear Logical Deduction** - Straightforward reasoning chains
3. **Factual Information Processing** - Simple knowledge retrieval
4. **Emotional Simulation** - Affective rather than cognitive modeling
5. **Real-Time Adaptation** - Dynamic, context-sensitive responses

## Experimental Design Recommendations

### Control Variables:
- **Belief Complexity**: Simple vs. complex belief systems
- **Reflection Depth**: Number of recursive iterations
- **Operator Type**: Reflect(λ) vs. Reflect(¬λ) vs. other operators
- **Domain**: Abstract philosophical vs. concrete practical beliefs

### Measurement Protocol:
1. **Baseline Assessment**: Rate agent's initial belief coherence
2. **Process Tracking**: Monitor recursive depth and stability
3. **Outcome Evaluation**: Assess conceptual shift quality
4. **Comparative Analysis**: Compare different reflection operators
5. **Synthesis Review**: Evaluate overall experimental insights

## Scoring Framework

### Overall Effectiveness Score:
- **Total Score**: Sum of all dimension scores (5-25 range)
- **Weighted Score**: Emphasize dimensions most relevant to your research goals
- **Comparative Score**: Rate relative to other approaches or baselines

### Specific Use Case Ratings:
- **Philosophical Inquiry**: How well does it handle abstract conceptual problems?
- **Cognitive Modeling**: How accurately does it simulate complex belief systems?
- **Recursive Analysis**: How effectively does it navigate self-referential structures?
- **Paradox Resolution**: How well does it work with contradictions and tensions?

## Field Experiment Template

### Pre-Experiment Setup:
1. Define target belief system
2. Specify reflection operation
3. Set evaluation criteria
4. Establish baseline metrics

### During Experiment:
1. Monitor belief consistency
2. Track recursive depth
3. Note conceptual shifts
4. Identify paradoxes/tensions

### Post-Experiment Analysis:
1. Score all dimensions
2. Identify key insights
3. Compare to other approaches
4. Document lessons learned

This framework should help you systematically evaluate the effectiveness of your agent simulation and logic shift experiments while identifying specific strengths and weaknesses of the approach.
