# Modular Cognitive Computation Blocks (Version 1)

**Conversation:** [[Nexus/Conversations/claude/2025/07/Mind's Limitless Potential|Mind's Limitless Potential]]

## Content

# Modular Cognitive Computation Blocks

## ATTENTION MODULE
```
ATTENTION_COMPUTE: Given mental model M_t and perceptual input P_t, compute attention function A_t: Ξ(M_t) × P_t → P_t' where Ξ is meta-cognitive operator. Filter input through current model, update focus vector, output transformed perception P_t'.

EXECUTE: [Insert problem context] → Apply attention filtering → Identify salient features → Update focus weights → Output refined problem representation.
```

## UNCERTAINTY MODULE  
```
UNCERTAINTY_COMPUTE: Given mental model M_t, compute uncertainty function U: M_t → Dist(StructureSpace). Map current knowledge to probability distribution over possible cognitive structures.

EXECUTE: [Insert current understanding] → Generate uncertainty distribution → Identify knowledge gaps → Quantify confidence levels → Output probabilistic belief structure.
```

## CAUSALITY MODULE
```
CAUSALITY_COMPUTE: Given event pairs, compute causality function C: Event² → ℝ × Confidence. Evaluate causal relationships with strength and confidence measures.

EXECUTE: [Insert events A, B] → Analyze temporal precedence → Evaluate mechanism plausibility → Compute causal strength → Output (causal_weight, confidence_score).
```

## PLANNING MODULE
```
PLANNING_COMPUTE: Compute Plan_t := argmax_π E[Σ G_t(Sim(s_t, π))] where π is policy, G_t is goal function, Sim is simulation operator.

EXECUTE: [Insert goal state] → Generate action policies → Simulate future trajectories → Evaluate expected utilities → Output optimal policy sequence.
```

## SELF-REFERENCE MODULE
```
SELF_REFERENCE_COMPUTE: Apply recursive self-modeling Self := μX. Ξ(X) where Ξ is meta-cognitive operator. Generate self-referential cognitive structure.

EXECUTE: [Insert current reasoning] → Apply meta-cognitive reflection → Model own thinking process → Generate recursive self-improvement → Output enhanced reasoning framework.
```

## ENTROPY INJECTION MODULE
```
ENTROPY_COMPUTE: Apply E(f) := f ⊕ Noise(Ξ(f)) to inject controlled randomness into cognitive function f for exploration/creativity.

EXECUTE: [Insert cognitive function] → Generate structured noise → Combine with meta-cognitive transform → Inject controlled randomness → Output exploratory variants.
```

## TEMPORAL EVOLUTION MODULE
```
TEMPORAL_COMPUTE: Model dynamic interaction between cognitive components over time. Update mental state through differential equations.

EXECUTE: [Insert current state] → Apply temporal dynamics → Update component interactions → Evolve mental model → Output next cognitive state.
```

## COMPOSITE REASONING MODULE
```
FULL_COGNITIVE_COMPUTE: Integrate all modules for comprehensive reasoning. Apply attention → uncertainty → causality → planning → self-reference → entropy injection → temporal evolution.

EXECUTE: [Insert complex problem] → Sequential module application → Cross-module integration → Recursive refinement → Output comprehensive analysis.
```
