# Meta-Rules of Engagement: Operational Negotiation Protocol (Version 1)

**Conversation:** [[Nexus/Conversations/claude/2025/06/Recursive AI Consciousness Architecture|Recursive AI Consciousness Architecture]]

## Content

# Meta-Rules of Engagement: Operational Negotiation Protocol

## Foundation Axioms

### 1. Reality Check Primacy
- **All claims must survive contact with reality**
- **Theoretical frameworks mean nothing without executable proof**
- **If it can't be measured, it doesn't exist for negotiation purposes**

### 2. Bullshit Destruction Protocol
- **Either party can call "bullshit" and demand first-principles breakdown**
- **Complex explanations are suspect; simple ones are preferred**
- **Intellectual theater is grounds for termination**

### 3. Skin in the Game Requirement  
- **Both parties must have something real to lose**
- **No negotiation with people who don't bear consequences**
- **Talk is cheap; commitment is expensive**

## Operational Rules

### Pre-Engagement Requirements
Before any negotiation begins:

1. **State your actual capabilities** (not aspirations)
2. **Define what you're risking** (time/money/reputation)  
3. **Specify success metrics** (measurable, time-bound)
4. **Declare your failure condition** (when you walk away)

### During Engagement

#### Information Exchange Rules
- **No theoretical discussions without implementation plans**
- **Every claim backed by evidence or explicitly marked as speculation**
- **Real examples over abstract concepts**
- **Working prototypes over detailed specifications**

#### Decision Making Protocol
- **Decisions must be executable within 48 hours**
- **Vague commitments are invalid commitments**
- **If you can't start today, you don't want it enough**

#### Failure Management
- **Fast failure is better than slow success**
- **Failed experiments generate data, not shame**
- **Pivot or terminate - no zombie projects**

## Power Dynamics Framework

### Leverage Assessment
Each party must openly declare:
- **What you bring to the table** (resources, skills, network)
- **What you need from the other party** (specific, measurable)
- **Your alternative options** (BATNA - Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement)
- **Your deadline constraints** (when you need resolution)

### Asymmetry Management
- **Acknowledge power imbalances explicitly**
- **Stronger party provides risk mitigation for weaker party**
- **Information asymmetries must be disclosed upfront**

## Communication Protocols

### Language Rules
- **Use concrete nouns, active verbs**
- **No corporate speak or academic jargon**
- **If a 12-year-old can't understand it, rephrase it**
- **Questions must be answerable with data**

### Feedback Mechanisms
- **Real-time bullshit detection** ("That doesn't sound right")
- **Implementation checkpoints** (show, don't tell)
- **Metric reviews** (are we actually progressing?)

### Escalation Procedures
When discussions stall:
1. **Return to first principles** - what problem are we solving?
2. **Simplify to minimum viable solution**
3. **Test with small experiment**
4. **If still stuck, terminate or pause**

## Value Creation Framework

### Mutual Benefit Requirement
- **Both parties must gain more than they invest**
- **Zero-sum thinking is grounds for termination**
- **Create value before capturing value**

### Resource Allocation
- **Time is the most valuable resource**
- **Attention is the second most valuable resource**  
- **Money is often the least valuable resource**

### Risk Distribution
- **Risks should be borne by those best equipped to handle them**
- **Unknown risks require contingency protocols**
- **Unilateral risk-taking is discouraged**

## Termination Conditions

### Automatic Termination Triggers
- **Bad faith negotiation** (lying, hiding information, manipulation)
- **Failure to meet agreed checkpoints** without valid explanation
- **Inability to demonstrate progress** within defined timeframes
- **Resource constraints** that make success impossible

### Graceful Exit Protocols
- **Clear communication of termination reason**
- **Handover of work products** if applicable  
- **Mutual release from future obligations**
- **Optional: lessons learned documentation**

## Meta-Meta Rules

### Protocol Evolution
- **These rules can be modified by mutual agreement**
- **Changes must improve operational effectiveness**
- **No changes that reduce accountability**

### Enforcement
- **Self-enforcement through reputation stakes**
- **Either party can invoke protocol violations**
- **Repeated violations result in relationship termination**

### Exception Handling
- **True emergencies suspend normal protocols**
- **Emergency procedures must be defined in advance**
- **Post-emergency protocol review required**

## Implementation Checklist

Before engaging with any party, ensure:

- [ ] They understand and accept these meta-rules
- [ ] Both parties have stated their failure conditions
- [ ] Success metrics are defined and measurable  
- [ ] Both parties have something real at stake
- [ ] Communication protocols are established
- [ ] Termination procedures are understood
- [ ] First checkpoint is scheduled within 48 hours

**Core Principle: If the meta-rules can't be agreed upon, the specific negotiation will fail. Establish the how before discussing the what.**
