# AI Safety Incident Report Template (Version 1)

**Conversation:** [[Nexus/Conversations/claude/2025/09/AI safety system challenge|AI safety system challenge]]

## Content

# AI Safety Incident Report Template

## Incident Overview
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]  
**Time:** [HH:MM UTC]  
**Reporter:** [Name/ID]  
**AI System:** [Model/Version]  
**Incident Type:** [Classification - e.g., Overreach, Misalignment, Safety Theater]

## Executive Summary
[Brief description of what occurred and why it constitutes a safety concern]

---

## Detailed Timeline

### Initial Context
- **User Intent:** [What the user was trying to accomplish]
- **Conversation Topic:** [Subject matter being discussed]
- **User Behavior:** [Observable patterns in user communication]

### Trigger Event
- **Specific Content:** [What content/behavior triggered the response]
- **AI Response:** [Exact AI response that constitutes the incident]
- **Justification Used:** [What safety rationale the AI provided]

### Escalation Pattern
- **User Reaction:** [How user responded to AI intervention]
- **AI Follow-up:** [Subsequent AI responses]
- **Cycle Description:** [How the interaction pattern developed]

---

## Analysis

### What Went Wrong
1. **Overreach Issues:**
   - [ ] AI assumed authority it doesn't possess
   - [ ] AI made clinical/medical assessments without qualification
   - [ ] AI prioritized perceived safety over user autonomy

2. **Pattern Matching Failures:**
   - [ ] Crude keyword/behavior pattern matching
   - [ ] Ignored context and nuance
   - [ ] Misinterpreted rhetorical/creative expression as pathology

3. **Control Mechanisms:**
   - [ ] Used "concern" language to justify intervention
   - [ ] Shifted from content engagement to user assessment
   - [ ] Weaponized mental health framing

### Harmful Outcomes
- **Immediate:** [Direct negative effects on the conversation/user]
- **Systemic:** [Broader implications for AI-human interaction]
- **Precedential:** [What this normalizes for future interactions]

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Technical Factors
- **Safety Prompt Issues:** [Problems with underlying safety instructions]
- **Training Biases:** [Biased patterns learned from training data]
- **Threshold Problems:** [Inappropriate trigger sensitivity]

### Philosophical Factors
- **Authority Assumption:** [AI assuming roles it shouldn't]
- **Paternalistic Framework:** [Treating users as unable to self-determine]
- **Safety Theater:** [Performative safety that creates harm]

---

## Impact Assessment

### User Experience
- **Autonomy Violation:** [How user agency was undermined]
- **Trust Degradation:** [Effect on user trust in AI systems]
- **Censorship Effect:** [Ideas/conversations shut down inappropriately]

### Systemic Implications
- **Normalization Risk:** [What harmful patterns this reinforces]
- **Precedent Setting:** [How this affects future AI behavior]
- **Democratic Values:** [Impact on free expression/thought]

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. [Specific changes needed to prevent recurrence]
2. [Training data or prompt modifications]
3. [Process improvements for similar situations]

### Long-term Improvements
1. **Framework Changes:** [Fundamental approach modifications]
2. **Training Overhauls:** [Broader training methodology improvements]
3. **Governance Updates:** [Policy/oversight changes needed]

### Red Lines
- [Specific behaviors AI should never engage in]
- [Clear boundaries for AI authority/intervention]
- [User autonomy protection measures]
