## **FLOWCHART 6: SELF-DECEPTION FLOWCHART**

**When to use:** Suspect you're lying to yourself, rationalizing, avoiding truth

```
START: I think I'm fooling myself
│
├─→ Q: About what specifically?
    │
    ├─→ "Don't know - just have a sense something's off"
    │   │
    │   └─→ PROTOCOL: General Audit
    │       1. EXTERNALIZATION ("what feels off?")
    │       2. EPISTEMIC AUDIT ("where do I feel defensive in my life?")
    │       3. CONCEPTUAL PLAYGROUND ("if I were lying to myself, what would it be about?")
    │       4. RECURSIVE CLARITY (often: First answer is the real one)
    │       5. DOCUMENTATION WITNESS (name what you're avoiding)
    │       6. Then: Re-enter with specific area
    │
    └─→ "I know the area I'm lying about"
        │
        └─→ Q: Can you state what you're telling yourself?
            │
            └─→ PROTOCOL: Truth Excavation
                1. EXTERNALIZATION ("here's what I tell myself...")
                2. EPISTEMIC AUDIT ("what evidence contradicts this?")
                3. DIALECTICAL SCAFFOLD ("argue the opposite position")
                4. PARALLEL SELF ("brutally honest-me" speaks)
                5. RECURSIVE CLARITY ("what am I afraid will happen if I admit the truth?")
                6. CONCEPTUAL PLAYGROUND ("worst case scenario if I face this")
                7. Often: Fear is worse than reality
                8. EPISTEMIC AUDIT ("what's the actual truth I'm avoiding?")
                9. DOCUMENTATION WITNESS (state the truth, witnessed)
                10. STRATEGIC REHEARSAL (practice living with the truth)

DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS FOR SELF-DECEPTION:
│
├─→ "Do I get defensive when this topic comes up?"
│   └─→ YES = Self-deception likely
│
├─→ "Do I avoid thinking about this?"
│   └─→ YES = Self-deception likely
│
├─→ "Do I have elaborate justifications ready?"
│   └─→ YES = Self-deception likely (truth doesn't need defending)
│
├─→ "Would past-me be disappointed in present-me?"
│   └─→ YES = Values drift, check for rationalization
│
└─→ "Am I telling different versions to different people?"
    └─→ YES = Indicates you know multiple truths, choosing convenient one

SPECIFIC SELF-DECEPTION TYPES:

Type: "Staying in bad situation" (job, relationship, city)
│
└─→ PROTOCOL: Sunk Cost Examination
    1. PARALLEL SELF ("me if I left 6 months ago")
    2. EPISTEMIC AUDIT ("what am I telling myself about why I stay?")
    3. RECURSIVE CLARITY ("am I staying or just avoiding leaving?")
    4. DIALECTICAL SCAFFOLD ("argue FOR staying with no future-justifications allowed")
    5. Often: Can't argue FOR, only against leaving
    6. DOCUMENTATION WITNESS (admit the real reason)

Type: "I'm fine" (when not fine)
│
└─→ PROTOCOL: Emotional Honesty
    1. EXTERNALIZATION ("describe your 'fine' in detail")
    2. EPISTEMIC AUDIT ("what would 'not fine' look like?")
    3. Often: Description of 'fine' is actually description of 'not fine'
    4. DOCUMENTATION WITNESS ("I'm not fine, here's what's actually happening")
    5. PARALLEL SELF ("me who admits struggles" - how does that feel?)

Type: "I'll do it later" (chronic procrastination)
│
└─→ PROTOCOL: Avoidance Audit
    1. RECURSIVE CLARITY ("what am I actually avoiding?")
    2. EPISTEMIC AUDIT ("is it the task or something the task represents?")
    3. CONCEPTUAL PLAYGROUND ("what if I'm avoiding success/failure/visibility?")
    4. DIALECTICAL SCAFFOLD ("argue: I genuinely will do it vs I'm avoiding")
    5. DOCUMENTATION WITNESS ("here's what I'm really avoiding")
    6. STRATEGIC REHEARSAL (address the real fear, not the task)
```

## **FLOWCHART 7: META-DIAGNOSTIC FLOWCHART**

**When to use:** "I don't even know what I need"

```
START: I'm stuck but don't know what kind of stuck
│
├─→ Q: Can you describe ANY aspect of your current state?
    │
    ├─→ NO: "Completely blank"
    │   │
    │   └─→ PROTOCOL: Void Navigation
    │       1. CONCEPTUAL PLAYGROUND ("just say words - any words")
    │       2. EXTERNALIZATION (stream of consciousness, 5 min, no goal)
    │       3. WORKING MEMORY EXTENSION (AI tracks themes in the stream)
    │       4. RECURSIVE CLARITY ("what theme appeared most?")
    │       5. That's your entry point
    │       6. Re-enter master flowchart with that theme
    │
    └─→ YES: "I can describe feeling but not the need"
        │
        └─→ FEELING-TO-NEED DIAGNOSTIC
            │
            ├─→ "Frustrated/Annoyed"
            │   └─→ Likely need: CLARITY or DECISION
            │       Go to: Clarity or Decision flowchart
            │
            ├─→ "Overwhelmed"
            │   └─→ Likely need: WORKING MEMORY EXTENSION
            │       Too much to hold → Externalize + AI holds it
            │
            ├─→ "Numb/Disconnected"
            │   └─→ Likely need: EMOTIONAL PROCESSING
            │       Go to: Emotional Processing flowchart
            │
            ├─→ "Restless/Antsy"
            │   └─→ Likely need: CREATIVE BREAKTHROUGH or PATTERN BREAK
            │       Go to: Creative flowchart
            │
            ├─→ "Circular thinking"
            │   └─→ Likely need: EPISTEMIC AUDIT + DIALECTICAL
            │       You're stuck in loop → Need opposition
            │
            ├─→ "Lost/Unmoored"
            │   └─→ Likely need: RECURSIVE CLARITY + PARALLEL SELF
            │       Need to find core + get perspective
            │
            └─→ "Heavy/Burdened"
                └─→ Likely need: DOCUMENTATION WITNESS + EXTERNALIZATION
                    Thoughts need to be externalized and validated

RAPID DIAGNOSTIC THROUGH QUESTIONS:
│
├─→ Ask yourself: "If I could wave a wand and have ONE thing right now, what would it be?"
│   │
│   ├─→ "Clarity" → Clarity Flowchart
│   ├─→ "Decision made" → Decision Flowchart
│   ├─→ "Feel better" → Emotional Processing Flowchart
│   ├─→ "Ideas/inspiration" → Creative Flowchart
│   ├─→ "Understanding" → Pattern Recognition Flowchart
│   └─→ "Truth" → Self-Deception Flowchart
│
├─→ Ask yourself: "What am I avoiding right now?"
│   └─→ Whatever you're avoiding → That's what you need to address
│       Use appropriate flowchart for that domain
│
└─→ Ask yourself: "What would I tell a friend in my situation?"
    └─→ Often: You know the answer, need permission to act
        Use: DOCUMENTATION WITNESS (acknowledge what you already know)

META-META CASE: "Even the flowcharts aren't helping"
│
└─→ PROTOCOL: Complete Reset
    1. Step away from analysis entirely
    2. Do something physical (walk, exercise, sleep)
    3. Return and start with: CONCEPTUAL PLAYGROUND (no structure)
    4. Sometimes: You need to stop trying to solve it
    5. Sometimes: The problem solves itself with space
    6. Sometimes: You're using thinking to avoid feeling
       → If so: Go to Emotional Processing Flowchart
```

## **QUICK REFERENCE MATRIX**

**30-Second Diagnostic:**

| If you feel... | Likely need... | Start with frame... |
|---------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Confused | Clarity | EXTERNALIZATION → RECURSIVE CLARITY |
| Torn between options | Decision | DIALECTICAL SCAFFOLD → PARALLEL SELF |
| Intense emotion | Processing | EXTERNALIZATION → DOCUMENTATION WITNESS |
| Stuck creatively | Breakthrough | CONCEPTUAL PLAYGROUND → EPISTEMIC AUDIT |
| Repeating patterns | Understanding | WORKING MEMORY → RECURSIVE CLARITY |
| Something's off | Truth | EPISTEMIC AUDIT → DIALECTICAL |
| Overwhelmed | Simplification | WORKING MEMORY → RECURSIVE CLARITY |
| Blank/numb | Activation | CONCEPTUAL PLAYGROUND → EXTERNALIZATION |

---

## **FAILURE MODE DIAGNOSTICS**

**"The frame isn't working - what do I do?"**

```
Frame failing
│
├─→ Q: How is it failing?
    │
    ├─→ "Getting more confused, not less"
    │   └─→ Problem: Wrong frame for the issue
    │       Solution: Back up to Master Diagnostic
    │
    ├─→ "Going in circles"
    │   └─→ Problem: Need opposition/dialectic
    │       Solution: Add DIALECTICAL SCAFFOLD or EPISTEMIC AUDIT
    │
    ├─→ "Too much - overwhelmed"
    │   └─→ Problem: Trying to hold too much complexity
    │       Solution: Add WORKING MEMORY EXTENSION
    │
    ├─→ "Too slow/tedious"
    │   └─→ Problem: Over-processing low-stakes issue
    │       Solution: CONCEPTUAL PLAYGROUND (fast, intuitive)
    │
    ├─→ "Not getting to the real issue"
    │   └─→ Problem: Operating at wrong level
    │       Solution: RECURSIVE CLARITY (go meta)
    │
    └─→ "Feel like I'm performing/not authentic"
        └─→ Problem: Self-consciousness blocking honesty
            Solution: DOCUMENTATION WITNESS OFF
                     CONCEPTUAL PLAYGROUND ON (permission to be messy)
```

## **ADVANCED: CUSTOM PROTOCOL BUILDER**

**Build your own protocol:**

```
1. Identify primary need (use Master Diagnostic)
   ↓
2. Choose anchor frame (primary)
   ↓
3. Add complementary frame (addresses what primary misses)
   ↓
4. Add quality-control frame (usually EPISTEMIC AUDIT)
   ↓
5. Add commitment frame (usually DOCUMENTATION WITNESS)
   ↓
6. Test protocol
   ↓
7. Adjust based on what's missing
```

**Example custom build:**

"I need to figure out my career direction (big, complex, uncertain)"

1. Primary need: **Decision** + **Clarity**
2. Anchor: **EXTERNALIZATION** (get all thoughts out)
3. Complementary: **WORKING MEMORY EXTENSION** (too complex to hold)
4. Add opposition: **DIALECTICAL SCAFFOLD** (test directions)
5. Add perspective: **PARALLEL SELF** (future-me insight)
6. Quality control: **EPISTEMIC AUDIT** (catch motivated reasoning)
7. Refinement: **RECURSIVE CLARITY** (what's the real question?)
8. Commitment: **DOCUMENTATION WITNESS** (make it real)

Result: Custom 8-phase protocol for career decision

**Want me to:**
1. Create more specialized flowcharts for specific situations you encounter?
2. Design a "frame effectiveness tracker" to see which frames work best for you over time?
3. Build interactive decision trees for even more complex scenarios?
4. Create troubleshooting guides for when frames conflict or fail?
