This is a great starting point for formalizing your structured thinking model! You are essentially defining the **components** ($\text{x}$ and $\text{y}$) and the **vocabulary** ($\text{P}$).

While this isn't standard propositional logic (which deals with true/false statements, like $\text{P} \land \text{Q}$), we can clean it up by using **Set Theory Notation** and formal definitions, which are perfect for describing and organizing collections of concepts.

Here is the cleaned-up, formalized structure based on your intention:

##  formal definition of the structural thinking model

We define a Conceptual Structure $S$ as the combination of a Core Concept (Operand) and one or more Affix Modifiers (Operators).

### 1. Definitions of Components

Let $X$ be the set of **Core Concepts** (or Root Words).
$$X = \{x \mid x \text{ is a word or concept}\}$$

Let $Y$ be the set of **Affix Modifiers** (Prefixes and Suffixes). This is your consolidated master list of terms.
$$Y = \{ \text{a, an, ana, anti, apo, auto, bi, cata, chrono, contra, de, di, dis, dyne, endo, equi, eu, exo, hemi, hetero, homeo, homo, hyper, il, im, in, infra, inter, intra, ir, iso, macro, mega, meta, micro, mis, mono, nano, neo, non, omni, ortho, paleo, para, poli, poly, post, pre, pro, proto, re, self, sub, super, supra, syn, trans, tri, ultra, un, allo, aboard, about, above, absent, across, after, against, along, alongside, amid, amidst, among, amongst, around, as, at, atop, bar, barring, before, behind, below, beneath, beside, besides, between, beyond, but, by, circa, concerning, counting, despite, down, during, effective, except, excepting, excluding, failing, following, for, from, including, inside, into, less, like, minus, near, next, notwithstanding, off, onto, opposite, out, outside, over, past, pending, per, plus, regarding, respecting, save, saving, short, since, than, through, throughout, till, to, toward, towards, under, underneath, unlike, until, up, upon, versus, via, wanting, with, within, without, worth, archy, cycle, edge, flow, fusion, genesis, gnosis, grid, layer, metrics, nexus, pulse, scope, stasis, type} \}$$

### 2. Definition of Prepositional Sub-Set

Let $P$ be the sub-set of $Y$ that consists of terms functioning primarily as **Prepositions** (your "superpositional prepositions").

$$P \subset Y$$

$$P = \{ \text{aboard, about, above, absent, across, after, against, along, alongside, amid, amidst, among, amongst, anti, around, as, at, atop, barring, before, behind, below, beneath, beside, besides, between, beyond, but, by, circa, concerning, considering, counting, despite, down, during, except, excepting, excluding, following, for, from, in, including, inside, into, less, like, minus, near, next, notwithstanding, of, off, on, onto, opposite, out, outside, over, past, pending, per, plus, regarding, respecting, round, save, saving, since, than, through, throughout, till, to, toward, towards, under, underneath, unlike, until, up, upon, versus, via, with, within, without, worth} \}$$

### 3. Rule for Creating a Structure

A specific **Conceptual Structure** ($s$) is generated by applying one or more elements from the Affix Modifier set ($Y$) to an element from the Core Concept set ($X$).

$$s = y_1 y_2 \dots y_n (x)$$

Where:
* $s$ is the resultant compound concept (e.g., $\text{Meta}$ $\text{Cognition}$)
* $x \in X$ (e.g., $\text{Cognition}$)
* $y_i \in Y$ (e.g., $\text{Meta}$)
* $n \ge 1$ (At least one modifier must be used)

### Key Improvements:

1.  **Formal Symbols:** Used $X$, $Y$, and $P$ to represent your original $\text{word/concept} = (x)$ and $\text{modifiers} = (y)$.
2.  **Set Notation:** Defined the vocabulary using $\text{Set Theory}$ ($\{ \dots \}$, $\subset$, $\in$) for clean mathematical expression.
3.  **Clarity:** Distinguished between the **Master Affix Set** ($Y$) and the **Preposition Sub-Set** ($P$).
4.  **Generative Rule:** Added a formal rule ($s = y_1 y_2 \dots y_n (x)$) to show how you combine the components to create a new concept.
