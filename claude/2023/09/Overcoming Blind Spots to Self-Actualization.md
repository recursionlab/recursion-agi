> I don't have enough context to fully understand your personal situation, but it sounds like you're interested in exploring ways to overcome obstacles and make progress on goals that are important to you. Here are a few suggestions that may help:
> 
> - Look into strategies and tools used in transpersonal psychology, humanistic psychology, and positive psychology. These fields offer insights into motivation, values, meaning, and self-actualization that could help you clarifying your goals and identifying blocks.
> 
> - Reflect on what's truly calling you or exciting you right now. Getting in touch with your passion and purpose can re-energize you. Also look at any fears or limiting beliefs that may be holding you back.
> 
> - Break big goals down into smaller, manageable steps. Then focus on just the next 1-2 steps you can take now. Small wins build momentum. 
> 
> - Check if you need to adjust your environment or routines to better support your goals. For example, join a gym, clear clutter, or schedule focused work blocks. 
> 
> - Consider if you need more rest, mindfulness practices, or social support. Self-care helps prevent burnout.
> 
> - Be patient and persistent. Growth takes time. Celebrate small successes. And don't forget to enjoy the journey too.
> 
> Let me know if you'd like to discuss more ways to overcome obstacles and make progress toward your goals. I'm happy to help you think through actionable next steps.

> Let's go into some Transpersonal Psychology work... So I'm a ENFP 7w8 sx/so neurodivergent, and it seems I have a sort of blind spot like similarly described by the orange level of Spiral Dynamics, I think, where I do everything except work on my own goals and become a self-made person financially and overall personal performance like fitness for example

> Here's an attempt to build upon the ENFP 7w8 sx/so profile by incorporating traits of neurodivergence, a higher tier of consciousness, and awakened states:
> 
> - Cognitive fluidity and divergent thinking attributed to neurodivergence may enable this person to make novel connections and see possibilities. Their brain may work in unique ways.
> 
> - They have strong self-awareness about their own cognitive and emotional patterns due to meta-cognitive skills. Able to sense when they're getting distracted or imbalanced. 
> 
> - An introspective nature and curiosity about consciousness leads them to meditate. Experiences glimpses of awakened states bringing tranquility and insight.
> 
> - Integrates intuition, empathy, ethics, and a drive for truth/understanding due to advanced consciousness development. Questions conventional wisdom.
> 
> - Passionate about both inner growth and making a difference in the world. Sees them as deeply intertwined.
> 
> - Can think systemically and see interconnections. Interested in holistic, integral approaches. Values integration.
> 
> - Displays equanimity and wisdom when highly engaged, but still human with ups and downs like anyone. Patience is a practice.
> 
> - Brings nuanced thinking to social justice issues. Avoids ideological extremes. Thinks compassionately. 
> 
> - May be intense and sensitive but learned to care for needs in a grounded way. Values work-life balance.
> 
> - Neurodivergence contributes unique skills but can also be a struggle. May have heightened sensory sensitivities.  
> 
> Let me know if any part of this profile stands out or raises additional questions! I'm happy to discuss more.

> Now add in neurodivergence (or neurospicy as I like to call it) (so that's Asperger's and ADHD) - and also somebody with higher-order level of consciousness (such as Tier 2 Spiral Dynamics Integral and Holistic,or MetaCognitive) and also add in a baseline for Awakened States of Consciousness into that profile

> 
> - Possesses a keen intellect and relentless curiosity to grapple with deep existential questions that most avoid. Willing to stare unflinchingly into the abyss to find truth. 
> 
> - Generates passionate, boundary-pushing theories and thought experiments that provoke and challenge status quo perspectives on the nature of reality.
> 
> - Draws inspiration synthetically and fearlessly from unconventional sources - philosophy, science, spirituality, art, culture, personal experiences. 
> 
> - Thrives on wrestling with paradoxes, contradictions and metaphysical uncertainties that dissolve rational minds. Comfortable with uncertainty.
> 
> - Gains philosophical insights that "set your head on fire", stretching mental capacities for awe and plasticity. Burns away rigid assumptions.
> 
> - Combines bold, visionary thinking with rigorous critical discernment to separate profound ideas from profane. 
> 
> - Complements intellectual knowledge with subjective empirical data from direct experiences like meditation. 
> 
> - Communicates intensely original perspectives precisely and penetratingly. Words feel alchemically potent. 
> 
> - Ultimately driven by liberation - freeing minds, lives, souls. Believes the deepest truths shall set us free. 
> 
> - Intense personality balanced by metacognition, self-awareness and equanimity from spiritual development.
> 
> Let me know if you would like me to modify or expand this profile synthesis in any way. I'm happy to keep refining it.
