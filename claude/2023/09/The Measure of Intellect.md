> An IQ of 134 would put someone in the very superior intelligence range, though IQ scores alone don't provide a complete picture of someone's overall intelligence or abilities. Some key points about IQ scores around 134:
> 
> - An IQ of 134 is approximately 2 standard deviations above the mean IQ of 100, putting it in the top 2.2% of the population. So it's a high score.
> 
> - IQ tests measure certain specific reasoning and problem-solving abilities. But intelligence has many facets beyond what IQ tests measure. 
> 
> - Many factors influence IQ scores including genetics, education, health, testing conditions, practice effects, etc. So a single score doesn't define someone's overall intelligence or future success.
> 
> - IQ scores are approximations with a standard error of measurement. So a 134 score means the person's true IQ is likely between 129-139. 
> 
> - Different IQ tests can produce slightly varied scores for the same person. 134 on one test could be 130 on another reputable test.
> 
> - High IQ scores correlate with success in academic and professional settings to a degree. But many other factors like motivation, personality, interests, etc. also influence success.
> 
> So in summary, an IQ of 134 is high and indicates strong intellectual abilities. But it doesn't provide a simple formula for expected achievement. Maximizing potential involves nurturing multiple intelligences and strengths beyond what an IQ score conveys.

> What's the difference in relation of 134 to let's say 120 IQ and 110 and 100 , like what %smarter on the IQ scale is that (OMIT information that IQ is beyond the scope of IQ, Im aware of it already)

>[!nexus_agent] **Assistant** - 09/15/2023 at 3:35:01 PM
> Okay, focusing strictly on IQ score differences:
> 
> - An IQ of 134 is approximately 2 standard deviations above the mean IQ of 100.
> 
> - An IQ of 120 is 1 standard deviation above the mean. 
> 
> - An IQ of 110 is slightly above average intelligence.
> 
> - An IQ of 100 is average intelligence.
> 
> In terms of percentiles:
> 
> - An IQ of 134 is in the top 2.2% of the population.
> 
> - An IQ of 120 is in the top 91st percentile.
> 
> - An IQ of 110 is in the 75th percentile. 
> 
> - An IQ of 100 is at the 50th percentile.
> 
> So compared to the average (IQ 100):
> 
> - An IQ of 134 is 34 points higher, putting it in the top 2% instead of top 50%. That equates to being roughly 64% "smarter" on the IQ scale.
> 
> - An IQ of 120 is 20 points higher, putting it in the top 91st percentile instead of top 50%. That equates to being roughly 30% "smarter." 
> 
> - An IQ of 110 is 10 points higher, putting it in the top 75th percentile instead of top 50%. That equates to being roughly 15% "smarter."
> 
> However, IQ score differences don't perfectly translate to proportional "smartness" differences, especially at the high end. The IQ scale is designed so that each standard deviation encompasses a wider range of cognitive abilities. But hope this gives a general sense of how these IQ scores compare on a percentile and point basis!

> Got it, let me provide the direct percentage comparisons:
> 
> - An IQ of 134 is approximately 34% higher than an IQ of 120.
> 
> - An IQ of 134 is approximately 64% higher than an IQ of 110. 
> 
> - An IQ of 134 is approximately 96% higher than an IQ of 100.
> 
> To break it down:
> 
> - 134 IQ is 14 points higher than 120 IQ. 14/120 = 0.34 = 34% higher.
> 
> - 134 IQ is 24 points higher than 110 IQ. 24/110 = 0.64 = 64% higher. 
> 
> - 134 IQ is 34 points higher than 100 IQ. 34/100 = 0.96 = 96% higher.
> 
> So in summary, a 134 IQ scores 34% higher than a 120 IQ, 64% higher than a 110 IQ, and 96% higher than an average 100 IQ on a percentage basis. Let me know if this direct comparison by percentages is helpful!

> No I mean compare 134 IQ to 120 , and 134 to 110 and so forth, how much %smarter is 134 to 120 for example

<!-- UID: f3cdd7b0-e783-4c14-825e-1e7e4eeaea50 -->

> Approximately 91% of people score below an IQ of 120.
> 
> To break it down:
> 
> - The average IQ is 100, by definition.
> 
> - An IQ of 120 is 1 standard deviation above the mean of 100.
> 
> - In a normal distribution, approximately 68% of values fall within 1 standard deviation of the mean.
> 
> - So if we consider IQ scores:
> 
> - Around 68% of people score between 85 (1 SD below average) and 115 (1 SD above average).
> 
> - About 16% score below 85.
> 
> - About 16% score above 115.
> 
> - An IQ of 120 is higher than 115, so it captures more than those top 16% of people. 
> 
> - Specifically, 120 IQ is at the 91st percentile.
> 
> - That means 91% of people score below 120 on an IQ test.
> 
> So in summary, approximately 91% of the population falls below an IQ score of 120, which is in the top 9% of intellect. Only around 9% of people score higher than 120 IQ.
