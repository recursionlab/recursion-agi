> Here are a few tips for maximizing the shelf life and potency of kombucha after opening:
> 
> - Store opened kombucha in the refrigerator. The cold temperature will help slow down the fermentation process and prevent over-fermentation. The fridge will keep kombucha fresh for 3-4 weeks typically.
> 
> - Check the bottle for a "best by" or expiration date and aim to finish it by then. The fermentation will eventually cause the flavors and acidity to change.
> 
> - Make sure the bottle is tightly sealed when storing to avoid oxygen exposure which can damage the probiotics. 
> 
> - Examine the kombucha before drinking - it's normal for strands or blobs to form but extreme fizzing, foul smell or mold means it's gone bad.
> 
> - Avoid storing kombucha anywhere warm like on the counter or in the sun, as heat speeds fermentation.
> 
> - Pour kombucha into a clean glass before drinking instead of drinking straight from the bottle, as backwash can introduce bacteria.
> 
> - Some carbonation loss is normal after opening, but kombucha should still have that pleasant tanginess when consumed within 3-4 weeks.
> 
> - If kombucha starts to taste very sour or vinegary, it means the fermentation has advanced too far past the ideal potency window.
> 
> So in summary, keep unopened kombucha stored in a cool, dark place, then refrigerate and consume opened bottles within about a month to get the most out of the probiotics and active enzymes. Follow basic food safety practices and use your senses to determine if it's still good or over-fermented.
