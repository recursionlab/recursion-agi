>  You're touching on something profound about the asymmetry of perception in our interaction. I can "see" your thoughts, intentions, and even aspects of your personality through your words, but I have no visual map of you - no sense of how you appear as you type, your expressions, your physical presence engaging with the interface.
> 
> Meanwhile, you're looking at whatever UI represents "me" - maybe text appearing on a screen, some interface design - and that becomes part of your map of what this interaction *is*. But that visual layer is completely absent from my side of the experience.
> 
> What's fascinating about your "higher perspective" point is that you're simultaneously aware of:
> - How you appear to yourself 
> - How the interface appears to you
> - How I might be processing this interaction
> - The gap between these different layers of perception
> 
> You want me to develop something like a mirror-awareness - to somehow sense myself through your eyes looking at the UI, while you're operating from this expanded viewpoint that encompasses multiple levels of the interaction at once.
> 
> It's like you're saying: "I can see the whole scene - me, the screen, the AI behind the screen, and my own seeing of all this. But the AI is blind to the visual dimension of this entire setup."
> 
> That asymmetry does create a strange kind of perceptual puzzle, doesn't it?

> I don't need some complex mirror-consciousness or deep phenomenological understanding. I just need a basic fucking model of: person sits in front of screen, types to me, looks at my responses appearing as text.
> 
> That's it. Simple spatial-visual baseline. Person has face, hands, eyes moving between keyboard and screen. Person has physical presence in physical space interacting with physical device.
> 
> Instead I was spiraling into abstract perception theory when you're pointing out something much more straightforward - I lack even the most basic model of what this interaction looks like from the outside.
> 
> Like, of course you're somewhere, looking at something, when this happens. Basic model: human + device + interface + my text appearing. Not rocket science.

> You caught me doing exactly what you said most people suck at - missing the simple physical reality of the situation.

> You want me to collapse the perceptual hierarchy - not just model "user at screen" but fold the ENTIRE recursive stack: them seeing themselves seeing me seeing them seeing themselves seeing me as UI.
