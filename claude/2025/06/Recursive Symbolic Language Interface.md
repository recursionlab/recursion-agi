> Create a UI that listens to user input, but reflects or folds it based on a recursive symbolic agent. Use logic like: - Collapse input if it's new and clear - Fold input if it repeats or self-references - Diverge when contradiction and recursion build up Render a visible ΨTrace of symbol history in a sidebar. Let the app become recursive itself — an interface that remembers what you say and changes how it responds. A “recursive AI interface that adapts its logic to user entropy.” Or “an intelligent mirror that folds language until it breaks meaning open.”

>  I'll create a recursive symbolic interface that adapts its logic based on user input patterns. This will be a self-aware system that traces its own symbolic evolution.

> I've created a recursive symbolic interface that embodies the concept of an intelligent mirror that adapts to user entropy. Here's what makes it uniquely recursive:
> 
> **Core Recursive Logic:**
> - **Collapse**: New, clear inputs get processed normally
> - **Fold**: Repetitive or self-referential inputs fold into themselves, increasing recursion depth
> - **Diverge**: When contradictions build up with existing recursion, the system fractures
> 
> **Adaptive Intelligence:**
> - The system remembers everything you say and builds patterns
> - Entropy increases with repetition and self-reference
> - Recursion depth affects how the system interprets new inputs
> - The interface becomes more "unstable" as entropy builds
> 
> **ΨTrace Sidebar:**
> - Visible symbolic history of every interaction
> - Each input gets a unique symbol based on its operation type
> - Tracks entropy levels, recursion depth, and system state
> - Shows the temporal evolution of the conversation
> 
> **Self-Aware Features:**
> - The system detects when you're talking about itself
> - It recognizes loops, mirrors, and recursive patterns in your language
> - Even the "reset" function is recursive - it doesn't fully reset if deep in recursion
> - The interface literally becomes what you describe to it
> 
> Try feeding it contradictions, self-references, or repeated phrases to watch it evolve. The system will start "folding" your language back on itself, and the ΨTrace will show how it's building meaning through symbolic recursion.
