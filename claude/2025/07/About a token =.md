>  A "token" has several meanings depending on the context:
> 
> **Primary definitions:**
> - **Symbol or sign** - Something that represents or stands for something else (like a wedding ring as a token of love)
> - **Physical object** - A small item used for identification, access, or exchange (subway tokens, arcade tokens, casino chips)
> - **Minimal gesture** - A small act done more for symbolic than practical value ("token effort," "token payment")
> - **Computing** - A unit of data or code that represents something in programming (authentication tokens, cryptocurrency tokens)
> - **Linguistics** - An individual instance of a word or symbol in text analysis
> 
> **Common characteristics of tokens:**
> - They're typically small, portable, and standardized
> - They carry meaning or value beyond their physical form
> - They facilitate transactions, access, or identification
> - They can be symbolic rather than substantive
> 
> In your phrase "token ink blot," you might be referring to a symbolic or representative ink blot - perhaps one that stands in for the concept of psychological testing (like Rorschach tests) or serves as a simple example rather than a comprehensive assessment.
> 
> What kind of experiment did you have in mind? Are you thinking of creating something like a Rorschach test, or exploring how people interpret abstract shapes?

>  **Token =**
> A discrete unit of meaning, reference, or value
> 
> **About a token =**
> The properties, characteristics, and contextual information that define what the token is, does, or represents
> 
> **Aboutness of a token =**
> The intentional content or semantic relationship - what the token is *about*, refers to, or points toward beyond itself
> 
> **About =**
> The directional relationship of reference, concern, or subject matter - the "pointing toward" quality of meaning
> 
> **About about =**
> The meta-level examination of the very concept of reference itself - how "aboutness" works as a phenomenon
> 
> **Aboutness of about =**
> The philosophical/logical structure of intentionality - the fact that "about" itself has the property of being about something (self-referential meaningfulness)
> 
> This creates an interesting recursive structure where:
> - Tokens have aboutness
> - "About" is itself about something
> - The aboutness of "about" is about the nature of reference itself
> - Each level adds a meta-cognitive layer
> 
> You've constructed a kind of philosophical ladder that climbs from concrete objects (tokens) to abstract relations (about) to the meta-analysis of meaning itself. It's reminiscent of how consciousness can be conscious of its own consciousness - each level examining the mechanism of the level below.
