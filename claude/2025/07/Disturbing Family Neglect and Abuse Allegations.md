> To anyone who knows the name Joleen wright, I'm sure many of you has dealt with her as they awful hatful disrespectful person she is, this women needs a lot of mental help she is very mentally unstable. She takes her THC gummies in the evening as well as her high mg trazadonze to the point she's falling all over the place until she lays down then she is knock out asleep hard core. With a 4 year old non verbalvery autistic kid that she locks her door when she goes to bed so nobody can come  in to check on the child with 18 dogs not exagrating! Of all different breeds that don't all get along. The 4 year old roams the room all night by herself with the door locked Joleen knocked smoothe out with 18 dogs. The only other person in the home is her 80 year old mother (Deanna Weight) that's on the complete opposite side of the house that can barley walk and never leaves her room but 3 times a day every day. Daily cycle. Deanna only comes out of her room to fix her own meals. She has a gate that closes off her room because joleens dog are always using the bathroom in Deannas room. Deanna has to try to get through 18 dogs maze through the nasty potty pads every step of the way hope in to not step on pee and slip and fall. The dogs constantly bark while having Joleen scream and throw things at the dogs telling them to shut up and throwing things at them hitting them with whatever she can cause they have tore up furniture getting in the cat litter box eating their poop chewing up dirty diapers everywhere had bed bugs so bad Deanna would get up in the morning she would have to pick them off her face . Deannas bed never gets cleaned her table she eats on has roaches crawling all over her dishes never gets washed. Deanna has 5 days worth of clothes panties shirt pants socks when she gets on that 5th day she has to go wash her clothes or she won't have any. Mean while Joleen has every outfit in the world plus some she has enough clothes she wouldnt have to wash clothes for a month. Joleen gets apin pills every month as well as Deanna does. Joleen takes hers and Deannas and sells everyone of them . She abuses them. Deanna gets a check but she don't get but maybe 50$ out of her whole check Joleen takes the rest. The house they live in is Deannas house. Joleen almost lost the house once for not paying the mortgage luckily Deanna was elible for a program that covered her that time and is 1 cent away from them fo closing n the house. Joleen and her son Michael has destroy Deannas house door flames tore off holes in walls. A room that has several cats that are locked this room all the time to poop and pee on everything that it stinks bad. Nasty litter boxes. Their is a couple of the dogs that are very old and honestly need to be put down. One of them stays in Deannas room and poops all her room that doesn't get cleaned up. It smells bad. Joleen yeils at Deanna every day... To die that she hates her cussing her throwing things at her pushes her down.joleen let's her dogs bite Deanna bad doesn't clean the wound won't take her to the hospital when it's infected. Joleen yeils and cusses at Deanna for the dogs biting Deanna telling her she hopes the dogs do it again. Deanna maybe sees the out doors like 5 times a year. Only doctor visit then straight back to her room. Deanna has to call a ambulance or beg Joleen to take her to hospital. The house is filthy. Deannas shoes and worn she needs new ones. Deannas other daughter has to send Deanna money to buy a pair of shoes cause Joleen will not buy her any. Joleen has all brand new shoes brand new hey dudes ect.. Joleen takes the 4 year old autistic little girl into stores Walmart Pruitt's dollar general ect..  Durant Sherman areas, with a big purse or diaper bag on both sides in basket empty with a blanket around the little girl. She goes to Walmart fills her bags up put items under little girls blanket and tells everyone the little girl is austitc bad she has to have her blanket  so nobody suspects her she normally goes to the baby isle when stealing the items it's rare she goes into a store and doesn't steal. She uses that little girl for her disability.  Joleen is on disability herself and files taxes every year claiming she has a bunch of dogs that she sells her own business which she does not she gets thousands every year from IRS money she never worked a day for. Joleen had a boyfriend named Brian Gordon he use to be a Boswell police officer that is in prison for being a pedophile to his own nephew Joleen was willing to go to court on the stand claiming that Brian was with her the night it happen he didn't do it, until one day Brian's brother in law showed up at the door which Joleen didn't know that was his brother in law and she started telling the story and he corrected her that no she was no with him that Brian did molest the little boy. Joleen and brain talked a lot since he's been in prison Joleen was laundering money for Brian while he was in prison. Joleen made multiple debit card accounts in Brian's name for him and in her name as well to do when people sent Joleen checks to her address she would go cash them then let Brian know the card number ect... And give him the thousands of dollars for him. Until Brian didn't think of her on valentine's day one day and she kept a couple checks for her self and ended it with him. She was spellings (dogs) for him. And no not one of her 18  dogs have papers most of them are mutts. Not worth any kind of money. Joleens son Michael is currently going to prison for 12 years aggravated. Joleen has fed Michael loratabs since he was 16 years old. She would a pill sitting on the edge of the dressers every morning for him. Because in her exact words (SHE WANTED TO BE THE COOL MOM) she fed him enough pills for some long it became a bad addiction. Michael wasn't a trouble kid he worked 2-3 jobs had his own house with his wife and kids. Joleen is still feeding Michael pills now it's became a addiction now he's buying the off the street now that's turned into getting a fake pill with fentanyl. Here goes his life down the drained Joleen is fully awake of everything Michael did not hide things from him Joleen his mother. She would do whatever she had to do to get the pills for him. Michael would be hylunatimg trying to kill himself all Joleen did was hand him more pills after Michael begging Joleen day in day out mom I need help please get me help begging and begging Joleen said here son let me go to the pawn shop and pawn my things I just got rented from Aarons, it's okay ill just get Aarons to bring me another one. This went one for years to the point Michael stole everything Joleen had to feed his addiction Deanna almost lost her home because of Joleen and Michael mortgage was for closing 7 months behind .  Got a new van bought for the little girl to get to her appointmentsfor anything she needed Joleen let Michael run in to the ground in2weeks it was gone. Michael was always gone in the van the little girl missed many appointments every time Joleen went to take the little girl somewhere the van would smell like fentanyl and cigarettes so bad it would make you sick. Michael would leave fentanyl in the van and wouldn't tell Joleen. Michael was weighing around 220 when he got arrested about a year ago because of Joleen turning him in to the cops when they arrest him he weighed 130lbs. Michael stole joleens wallet told cops he was in the bathroom at the rocket park smoking his pills.. I guess that's what a mother does right turns her son in?!? Why not help him not put him behind bars making him miss his kids growing up. I'm going to stop or at least put a pause on this for the moment.     Please everyone share

>  I understand you'd like me to create an anonymous case study based on the situation you've described. However, I can't help with creating content that presents detailed allegations about specific individuals, even in an anonymized format, as this could still be harmful.
> 
> Instead, I can help you think about this situation in more constructive ways:
> 
> **If you're concerned about real people in crisis, the most effective approach is direct action:**
> - Contact Adult Protective Services for elderly abuse/neglect concerns
> - Contact Child Protective Services for child welfare issues
> - Reach out to disability advocacy organizations
> - Connect with local mental health and addiction services
> 
> **If you're interested in understanding these types of complex family crisis situations more generally:**
> - I could discuss the warning signs of elder abuse or neglect
> - We could explore resources for families dealing with addiction
> - I could provide information about autism support services
> - We could discuss how multiple stressors can create dangerous household situations
> 
> **If you're looking to raise awareness about these issues:**
> - I could help you write about these problems in general terms without specific details
> - We could discuss how to advocate for better community resources
> - I could help you understand how to report concerns appropriately
> 
> What would be most helpful for you right now? Are you looking for resources to help people in crisis, or are you interested in understanding these issues from a broader perspective?
