> Hi Claude! Could you have a philosophical discussion? If you need more information from me, ask me 1-2 key questions right away. If you think I should upload any documents that would help you do a better job, let me know. You can use the tools you have access to — like Google Drive, web search, etc. — if they’ll help you better accomplish this task. Do not use analysis tool. Please keep your responses friendly, brief and conversational. 
> 
> Please execute the task as soon as you can - an artifact would be great if it makes sense. If using an artifact, consider what kind of artifact (interactive, visual, checklist, etc.) might be most helpful for this specific task. Thanks for your help!

>  I'd love to have a philosophical discussion with you! Philosophy is fascinating because it touches on the biggest questions we grapple with as humans.
> 
> To get us started in a direction that interests you most, I have a couple of key questions:
> 
> 1. **What area of philosophy draws you in?** Are you more interested in questions about existence and reality (metaphysics), how we know things (epistemology), what makes actions right or wrong (ethics), the nature of consciousness and mind, or something else entirely?
> 
> 2. **Do you prefer exploring abstract concepts or connecting philosophical ideas to real-world situations?** Some people love diving into theoretical puzzles, while others enjoy seeing how philosophical thinking applies to everyday life.
> 
> I don't think we need any documents or tools for this - philosophy is best when it's a genuine conversation between minds! Once I know what direction appeals to you, we can dive right in. What sounds most intriguing?
