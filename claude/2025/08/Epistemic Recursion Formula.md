> I see you've presented a recursive formula: F_{n+1} := R(C(F_n))
> 
> To properly engage with this "epistemic recursion engine," I'd need some clarification on the components:
> 
> - What does F represent? (Is it a knowledge state, belief set, theory, or something else?)
> - What are the operators R and C? (For example, are they revision, critique, reflection, composition functions?)
> - What's the initial condition F_0?
> - What domain are we working in?
> 
> The epistemic framing suggests this relates to iterative knowledge refinement or recursive reasoning processes, but without knowing what the symbols represent, I can't meaningfully apply or analyze the recursion.
> 
> Could you provide the definitions for these components, or let me know what specific aspect of this system you'd like to explore?
