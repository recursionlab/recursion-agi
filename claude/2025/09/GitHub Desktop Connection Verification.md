> I can see from your screenshot that GitHub shows as "Connected" in your Claude Desktop settings. However, looking at the tools I actually have access to in our conversation, I can see I have:
> 
> - Notion (search, fetch, create pages, etc.)
> - Google Drive (search and fetch)
> - Web search and fetch
> - Conversation search
> - Analysis tool
> 
> But I don't currently have any GitHub-specific tools available to me. The connection status in your settings interface doesn't always mean those tools are available in every conversation context.
> 
> If you need me to help with something GitHub-related, I'd be happy to try using web search to look up public repositories or help you with Git commands and workflows. Or if there's something specific you're trying to accomplish, let me know and I can suggest the best approach with the tools I do have available.

> What was I hoping to do with Github integration, use it? It does not matter what my intention was, because my intention was the result of the process being working. If you cannot connect to github , then you must write an email for anthropic outlining the details and specs of the errors, where you have CONNECTED as shown , and you are unable to connect,

> You're absolutely right - there's clearly a disconnect between what your settings show and what's actually working. I'll draft that email for you:
