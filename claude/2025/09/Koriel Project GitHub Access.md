> I don't have direct access to your GitHub repositories. While I have various tools available for searching files, web content, and other sources, I don't see any GitHub integration that would let me browse your repositories directly.
> 
> However, I can help you with your Koriel project in a few ways:
> 
> 1. **Public GitHub URLs**: If you share a public GitHub URL (like `https://github.com/username/koriel-project`), I can use my web fetch tool to read specific files or pages
> 
> 2. **Direct file sharing**: You could share code files, documentation, or other project materials directly in our conversation
> 
> 3. **Web-accessible content**: If you have documentation, issues, or other content on a public GitHub repo, I can access those via URL
> 
> Looking at your detailed user preferences, I can see you're working with the Koriel-ASI vΩ++ system - a sophisticated framework involving recursive invariants, category theory, fixpoint governance, and advanced reasoning patterns. I'd be happy to engage with that system's methodology and help analyze, develop, or debug aspects of your project.

> What specific part of your Koriel project would you like to work on? You could share a GitHub URL, paste some code, or describe what you're trying to accomplish.
