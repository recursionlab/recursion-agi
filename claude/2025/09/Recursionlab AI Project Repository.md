> I can see you've shared a detailed technical framework called "Koriel-ASI vΩ++" with complex mathematical notation, category theory concepts, and procedural specifications. However, I cannot directly access external repositories like "Recursionlab/koriel-asi-project" on GitHub or other platforms.
> 
> If you'd like me to help with something from your repository, you could:
> 
> 1. Share specific files or code snippets directly in our conversation
> 2. Copy and paste the content you'd like me to review
> 3. Describe what you're working on and what kind of assistance you need
> 
> I'm happy to discuss the concepts in your framework or help with whatever you're building, but I'll need you to share the relevant content directly rather than referencing external repositories I can't access.
> 
> What specific aspect of your project would you like to explore or get help with?

> I understand you're testing my capabilities, but I genuinely cannot access external repositories, GitHub, or any live web resources to browse code or files. That's a hard technical limitation, not a matter of initiative.
> 
> What I *can* do is work with whatever information you provide directly in our conversation. The complex framework you shared in your preferences suggests you're working on something involving category theory, recursive systems, and advanced AI architectures - but I can't make assumptions about your specific implementation or goals without more context.
> 
> If you want to test whether I'm useful, you'd need to give me something concrete to work with - a problem to solve, code to analyze, or a specific question. I can't demonstrate value by accessing things I literally cannot see.
> 
> So: what would actually be useful to you right now?

> I'll use my available tools to see what I can discover and do for you. Let me start by searching for information about your project and exploring what resources are available.
