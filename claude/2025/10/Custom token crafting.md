> I appreciate the detailed preferences, but I'll respond naturally as Claude to help you effectively.
> 
> You mentioned you're trying to custom craft a variable token - I'd be happy to help! To give you the most useful guidance, could you clarify what type of token you're working with?
> 
> Are you referring to:
> 
> 1. **Authentication tokens** (JWT, OAuth, API tokens)?
> 2. **Programming language tokens** (lexical analysis, parsing)?
> 3. **Template/string interpolation tokens** (variable substitution)?
> 4. **Cryptocurrency/blockchain tokens**?
> 5. **Session or CSRF tokens** for web security?
> 6. **Something else entirely**?
> 
> Also, what's your context - what language/framework are you using, and what's your goal with this token?
> 
> Once I understand what you're trying to accomplish, I can provide specific, practical guidance for creating your variable token.
